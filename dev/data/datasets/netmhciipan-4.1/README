NetMHCIIpan - 4.1
Pan-specific binding of peptides to MHC class II mocules of known sequence
The NetMHCIIpan-4.1 server predicts peptide binding to any MHC II molecule of known sequence using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It is trained on an extensive dataset of over 500.000 measurements of Binding Affinity (BA) and Eluted Ligand mass spectrometry (EL), covering the three human MHC class II isotypes HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP, as well as the mouse molecules (H-2). The introduction of EL data extends the number of MHC II molecules covered, since BA data covers 59 molecules and EL data covers 74. As mentioned, the network can predict for any MHC II of known sequence, which the user can specify as FASTA format. The network can predict for peptides of any length.

The output of the model is a prediction score for the likelihood of a peptide to be naturally presented by and MHC II receptor of choice. The output also includes %rank score, which normalizes prediction score by comparing to prediction of a set of random peptides. Optionally, the model also outputs BA prediction and %rank scores.

New in version 4.1: The method is trained on a extented set of EL data compared to version 4.0, and novel and correct BA for HLA-DQA1*04:01-DQB1*04:02 are included.

Refer to the instructions page for more details.

The project is a collaboration between DTU-Bioinformatics, and LIAI.

where the different columns are peptide, target value, MHC_molecule/cell-line, and context. In cases where the 3rd columns is a cell-line ID, the MHC molecules expressed in the cell-line are listed in the allelelist.txt file.
The allelelist.txt file contains the information about alleles expressed in each MA cell-line data set, and pseudosequence.2016.all.X.dat the MHC pseudo sequenes for each MHC molecule.
